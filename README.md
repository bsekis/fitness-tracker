# workoutracker-mongo
## description
The app stores the user's daily workouts. On the landing page the user can choose to add more exercises to their most recent workout or to create a new workout for the day and populate it with exercises. There is a stats page that returns data of the user's last 7 days of workouts.

## installation
The app is deployed on heroku, so there's nothing to install. It should also already have some seeded data so the stats route works right away.

The back end runs on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server and uses [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to work with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
